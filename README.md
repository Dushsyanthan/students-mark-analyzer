# Student Mark Analyzer 🎓📊

A simple Java project that helps analyze students' marks and generate performance insights. This was built as a mini project to practice object-oriented programming and file handling in Java.

## 📌 Features

- Add student details (name, roll number, subjects, and marks)
- Calculate total and average marks
- Grade assignment based on average
- Identify top performers
- Basic user interaction using console
- Simple and clean output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java, OOP)
- Scanner (for user input)
- Basic file handling (optional, if used)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter the number of students.
2. For each student, it collects:
   - Name
   - Roll Number
   - Marks for each subject
3. It calculates:
   - Total Marks
   - Average
   - Grade (A, B, C, etc.)
4. After collecting all the data, it shows a report with:
   - All student details
   - Highest scorer(s)
   - Average class performance (if implemented)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `.java` file.
2. Open it in any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or run using terminal.
3. Compile and run the program:

   ```bash
   javac StudentMarkAnalyzer.java
   java StudentMarkAnalyzer
